Version 3 of Cissanthemos is a color fontâ€”that is, one in which the
colors have been chosen by the designer. The colors of this font are
based on those of the manuscript on which the font is based ans on
other manuscripts contemporary with it. Capitals in this font can be
filled with color for emphasis or decoration, and the colors can be
customized in several ways; or, if you prefer, Cissanthemos can be 
used as an ordinary black-and-white font (for details, see the
[specimen page](https://psb1558.github.io/Cissanthemos-font/) and the
[Cissanthemos sample and guide](https://github.com/psb1558/Cissanthemos-font/blob/master/Cissanthemos%20sample%20and%20guide.pdf).)
